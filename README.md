# We cannot see CO2, but we can visualize it

- A flight from London to New York is around 590 kg CO2e per passenger. 

- A person can produce 5000 kg CO2e per year. 

- The production of 100 MWh using natural gas can release 40000 CO2e. 


### But how much are these quantities?

This experimental project is about visualizing in 3D how many gas canister or gas trucks would be necessary to store a given amount of CO2 in liquid form. 

It is also possible to see how many trees would be required to absorb such amount.
